\section*{Prior to Lab}

Before attending this lab:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Read and familiarize yourself with this handout.
  \item Review the lecture notes on conditionals, or the following free textbook resources: \url{http://www.toves.org/books/java/ch07-if/index.html}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Peer Programming Pair-Up}

To encourage collaboration and a team environment, labs will be
structured in a \emph{pair programming} setup.  At the start of
each lab, you will be randomly paired up with another student 
(conflicts such as absences will be dealt with by the lab instructor).
One of you will be designated the \emph{driver} and the other
the \emph{navigator}.  

The navigator will be responsible for reading the instructions and
telling the driver what to do next.  The driver will be in charge of the
keyboard and workstation.  Both driver and navigator are responsible
for suggesting fixes and solutions together.  Neither the navigator
nor the driver is ``in charge.''  Beyond your immediate pairing, you
are encouraged to help and interact and with other pairs in the lab.

Each week you should alternate: if you were a driver last week, 
be a navigator next, etc.  Resolve any issues (you were both drivers
last week) within your pair.  Ask the lab instructor to resolve issues
only when you cannot come to a consensus.  

Because of the peer programming setup of labs, it is absolutely 
essential that you complete any pre-lab activities and familiarize
yourself with the handouts prior to coming to lab.  Failure to do
so will negatively impact your ability to collaborate and work with 
others which may mean that you will not be able to complete the
lab.  

\section{Lab Objectives \& Topics}
At the end of this lab you should be familiar with the following
\begin{itemize}
  \item How basic control flow works
  \item When and how to use if, if-then-else, and if-else-if conditional 
  	statements in a program
\end{itemize}

\section{Background}

The default control flow in a typical program is sequential.  That is, 
each statement is executed one after the other.  However, we often 
have to make decisions based on program state or variable values.  
This is known as conditional control flow.  Java, like many programming 
languages, provides several control structures to alter the flow of 
control in a program based on the truth-value of some conditional 
statement.

An if-statement can be used to conditionally execute a block of code.  
If the condition in an if-statement evaluates to true the code block is 
executed, otherwise it is not.

\begin{minted}{java}
if(x > 0) {
  System.out.println("x is positive!\n");
  System.out.println("the value of sqrt(x) = " + Math.sqrt(x) + "\n");
}
\end{minted}

An if-then-else statement can be used to execute one of two mutually 
exclusive code blocks.  If the condition evaluates to true, then the first 
block is executed.  Otherwise, if the condition is false, the second code 
block is executed. 

\begin{minted}{c}
if(x > 0) {
  System.out.println("x is positive!\n");
  System.out.println("the value of sqrt(x) = " + Math.sqrt(x) + "\n");
} else {
  System.out.println("x is not positive, cannot compute its square root\n");
}
\end{minted}

An if-else-if statement can be used to execute one of several mutually 
exclusive statements.  It also requires more than one conditional 
statement to determine which code block should be executed.   The 
control flow of an if-else-if statement is such that the first condition that 
evaluates to true is executed.  All subsequent statements are skipped.  
If no condition holds true, then the else code block is executed.  
However, much like the difference between an if-statement and an 
if-then-else statement, the final else block is optional.

\begin{minted}{java}
if(x > 0) {
  System.out.println("x is positive!\n");
  System.out.println("the value of sqrt(x) = " + Math.sqrt(x) + "\n");
} else if(x == 0) {
  System.out.println("x is zero, its square root is zero\n");
} else {
  System.out.println("x is not positive, its square root is complex:\n");
  System.out.println(Math.sqrt(x*-1.0));
}
\end{minted}

Yet another type of conditional control statement is a switch statement.  
In a switch statement, a single variable's value is used to determine 
which, among several provided cases gets executed.


\begin{minted}{java}
switch(class_level) {
  case 1:
    System.out.println("Freshman");
    break;
  case 2:
    System.out.println("Sophomore");
    break;
  case 3:
    System.out.println("Junior");
    break;
  case 4:
    System.out.println("Senior");
    break;
  default:
    System.out.println("ERROR: Unknown value!");
    break;
}
\end{minted}

In Java, the switch-statement will work with the \mintinline{java}{byte}, 
\mintinline{java}{short}, \mintinline{java}{char}, and \mintinline{java}{int} 
primitive data types.  It can also work with the \mintinline{java}{String} 
class and enumerated types.  The most common form of error using switch 
statements is forgetting to include the break statement after each case.  
The break statement tells Java when to exit the switch selection structure.

In this lab you will write several programs that utilize control statements.

\subsection{Compound Statements}

Many logical statements require the use of logical operators that can 
be used to form more complex, compound statements.  The three 
logical operators that we'll focus on are as follows.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
\hline
Operator	& Java Syntax & Example \\
\hline\hline
Negation	& \mintinline{java}{!} & \mintinline{java}{!(x > 0)} \\
Logical And & \mintinline{java}{&&} & \mintinline{java}{(x != 0) && (y < 10)} \\ 
Logical  & \mintinline{java}{||} & \mintinline{java}{(x < 0) || (x >= 10)}
\end{tabular}
\caption{Logical Operators in Java}
\label{table:logicalConnectives}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Negation: this is a unary operator that flips the truth value of 
  	the statement or variable that it is applied to so that true becomes 
	false and vice versa.
  \item Logical And: this is a binary operator that is applied to two logical 
	expressions and evaluates to true if and only if both expressions are 
	true
  \item Logical Or: this is a binary operator that is applied to two logical 
	expressions and evaluates to true if at least one (or both) of the 
	expressions are true
\end{itemize}
	
Logical operators are necessary to do more complex statements such as 
checking for ranges of variable values.  For example, to check if a variable 
\mintinline{java}{x} lies in the range $[0, 10]$, one would need to use a logical and operator:

\begin{minted}{java}
if( x >= 0 && x <= 10 ) { 
  //code
}
\end{minted}

As another example, consider deciding whether or not the current year is 
a leap year.  The Gregorian calendar defines a year as a leap year if it is 
divisible by 4.  However, every year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year 
unless it is divisible by 400.  This logic can be modeled with the following 
expression.

\begin{minted}{java}
if( year % 400 == 0 || ( year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0 ) ) {
  printf("leap year!\n");
}
\end{minted}

\section{Activities}

We have provided partially completed programs for each of the following 
activities.  You will need to clone the Lab 03 project from Github using the URL:
\url{https://github.com/cbourke/CSCE155-Java-Lab03}.  Refer to previous
labs for a step-by-step process.

\subsection{Tax Program}

The federal income tax for a married couple filing jointly for 2012 is determined 
by the rules indicated in Table \ref{table:taxBrackets}.  In addition, the total tax is reduced by 
\$1000 for each child that a couple has.  

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
If the AGI is over- & But not over- & The tax is: & Of the amount over- \\
\hline\hline
\$0 & \$17,000 & 10\% & \$0 \\
\$17,000 & \$69,000 & \$1,700 + 15\% & \$17,000 \\
\$69,000 & \$139,350 & \$9,500 + 25\% & \$69,000 \\
\$139,350 & \$212,300 & \$27,087.50 + 28\% & \$139,350 \\
\$212,300 & \$379,150 & \$47,513.50 + 33\% & \$212,300 \\
\$379,150 & --  & \$102,574.00 + 35\% & \$379,150 \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{2012 Tax Brackets}
\label{table:taxBrackets}
\end{table}

We have provided a partially completed program that reads in a user's 
Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and prompts whether or not they have 
any children.  You need to complete the program by writing code to do 
the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If the user indicates that they do have children, prompt them to 
  	enter how many and compute the total tax credit
  \item Compute the user's tax based on the user's AGI and the total 
	tax after the child tax credit
\end{itemize}

Some example input/output results can be found in Table \ref{table:examples}.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|c|l}
AGI & Number of Kids & Taxes \\
\hline\hline
\$4,000 & 1 & \$0 \\
\$20,000 & 0 & \$2,150 \\
\$120,000 & 3 & \$19,250 \\
\$150,000 & 4 & \$26,069.50 \\
\$250,000 & 0 & \$59,954.50 \\
\$500,000 & 5 & \$139,871.50 \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Several example inputs/outputs.}
\label{table:examples}
\end{table}

Answer the questions on your worksheet.

\subsection{Calculator}

In this activity, you will implement a simple menu-based command line 
calculator.  A partially completed program has been provided to you, 
\mintinline{text}{Calculator.java}.  The program prompts the user for two operands 
and one of several different choices for an operation to be performed on 
them.  Your program should process the input and display the result of 
the chosen operation.  Take care with the following possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
  \item For division, you should check if $b = 0$ (division by zero is not defined).  
  	If it is, an appropriate error message should be output instead.
  \item For the logarithm operation, you should use the math library's \mintinline{java}{Math.log} 
	function, which is the natural logarithm (base $e$).  To change to another
	 base, use the formula:
	 	$$\log_a{(b)} = \frac{\ln(b)}{\ln(a)}$$
\end{itemize}

In addition, you should check that both operands are positive, if not 
then output an appropriate error message.

Complete the program and answer the questions on your worksheet.

\subsection{Triangles}

A triangle can be characterized in terms of the length of its three sides.  
In particular, an equilateral triangle is a triangle with all three sides being 
equal.  A triangle such that two sides have the same length is isosceles 
and a triangle with all three sides having a different length is scalene.  
Examples of each can be found in Figure \ref{fig:triangles}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{triangleEquilateral}~~~~~~~
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{triangleIsosceles}~~~~~~~
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{triangleScalene}
\caption{Examples of Equilateral, Isosceles, and Scalene triangles}
\label{fig:triangles}
\end{figure}

In addition, the three sides of a triangle are valid only if the sum of the 
length of any two sides is strictly greater than the length of the third side.  
In this exercise you will complete a program that determines if 3 values 
form a valid triangle.  If valid, the program should output whether or not 
the triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.  The program has been 
started for you (see \mintinline{text}{Triangles.java}), which reads in the three sides of a 
triangle via command line arguments.  Complete the program by 
implementing the logic to determine if the sides form a valid triangle 
and if so, what type.

\section{Handin/Grader Instructions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Hand in your completed files:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \mintinline{text}{Taxes.java}
    \item \mintinline{text}{Calculator.java}
    \item \mintinline{text}{Triangles.java}
    \item \mintinline{text}{worksheet.md}
  \end{itemize}
  through the webhandin (\url{https://cse-apps.unl.edu/handin}) 
  using your cse login and password.  
  \item Even if you worked with a partner, you \emph{both} should
  turn in all files.
  \item Verify your program by grading yourself through the
  webgrader (\url{https://cse.unl.edu/~cse155h/grade/}) using the
  same credentials.
  \item Recall that both expected output and your program's output
  will be displayed.  The formatting may differ slightly which is fine.
  As long as your program successfully compiles, runs and outputs 
  the \emph{same values}, it is considered correct.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Advanced Activity (Optional)}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Another conditional operator is the ternary if-then-else operator.  
  	It is often used to choose between two values.  For example:
	
	\mintinline{java}{int min = ( (a < b) ? a : b );}
	The syntax, \mintinline{c}{X ? Y : Z} is as follows: \mintinline{c}{X} 
	is any conditional statement; if it evaluates to true, then the 
	expression takes on the value \mintinline{c}{Y}; otherwise it takes 
	on the value \mintinline{c}{Z}.  Modify your programs to use this 
	ternary operator where appropriate.
  \item Change the calculator program as follows: add a menu option 
	so that the user has the option to quit; then add a loop so that 
	the program continues to print the menu.  As long as the user 
	performs an operation, it should continue until the user selects 
	the quit option.
\end{enumerate}
